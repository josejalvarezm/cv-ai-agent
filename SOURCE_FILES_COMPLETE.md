## Key Sanitization Changes

### 1. Removed Personal/Company References

- ❌ "CCHQ" → ✅ "Healthcare Platform" or "E-commerce Platform"
- ❌ Specific business names → ✅ Generic project names
- ❌ Personal credentials → ✅ .env.example templates

### 2. Simplified AI Prompts

**Before** (Private repo):

- 200+ line system prompt
- British English requirements
- Laconic style enforcement (max 3 sentences)
- Business hours validation
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Specific company mention requirements ("at CCHQ")
- Complex response quality validation
- Filler phrase removal regex

**After** (Public repo):

- ~20 line generic system prompt
- Focus on: "Provide concise answers about technical skills"
- Outcome-driven approach maintained
- No overly specific formatting rules
- Professional, accessible tone
- Suitable for any CV assistant use case

### 3. Removed Complex Features

Not included (too specific to private use case):

- Business hours validation (08:00-20:00 UK time)
- AI quota tracking with circuit breaker
- Project-specific detection ("at CCHQ" filtering)
- Response length enforcement (word counting)
- Employer-specific closing requirements
- Advanced caching with KV checkpoints
- Repository pattern abstractions

These can be added by users if needed, but aren't required for basic functionality.

### 4. Added Comprehensive Comments

Every function now includes:

- Purpose description
- Parameter documentation
- Return value explanation
- Usage examples (where helpful)
- Implementation notes

## Files NOT Included (By Design)

These files are too specific to the private implementation:

- `ai-quota.ts` - Neuron tracking (too specific)
- `input-validation.ts` - Business hours logic (too specific)
- `jwt.ts` - Placeholder in sessionHandler instead
- `utils.ts` - Not needed for simplified version
- `repositories/` - Abstraction layer (simplified in handlers)
- `quotaHandler.ts` - Not needed without quota tracking
- `indexManagementHandler.ts` - Advanced features (resume, stop, progress)

## TypeScript Errors Expected

All files show TypeScript errors for:

- `D1Database`, `Ai`, `KVNamespace` - Requires @cloudflare/workers-types
- `Request`, `Response`, `URL` - Requires Workers runtime types
- `console`, `caches` - Standard Workers globals

These resolve once tsconfig.json has proper `types` configuration and `wrangler dev` or `wrangler deploy` compiles with Cloudflare's types.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Core source files complete
2. ⏳ Documentation files (ARCHITECTURE.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, API.md)
3. ⏳ Scripts (deploy automation, indexing)
4. ⏳ Tests (similarity tests, integration tests)
5. ⏳ Test deployment from scratch
6. ⏳ Push to GitHub

## Validation Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:

- [ ] No CCHQ references in code
- [ ] No personal credentials
- [ ] All prompts are generic
- [ ] Examples use generic data (✅ seed data already generic)
- [ ] Comments explain WHY not just WHAT
- [ ] Code is beginner-friendly
- [ ] README accurately describes functionality
- [ ] Can be deployed by anyone with Cloudflare account
