## Impact

### Professional Tone
- More authoritative and confident language
- Clearer demonstration of technical leadership
- Better alignment with senior engineering role descriptions

### Action-Oriented
- Every entry starts with a concrete action verb
- Emphasizes initiative and ownership
- Shows direct contribution to outcomes

### Measurable Results
- Strong verbs pair naturally with quantifiable outcomes
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships
- Demonstrates business impact

## Pattern Applied

Each technology entry now follows this structure:

```
"summary": "[Strong Verb] [specific action/technology], [outcome/metric] at [Employer]."
"action": "[Strong Verb] [detailed technical approach]"
```

### Example:
```json
{
  "summary": "Engineered modular full-stack services from monolithic applications, cutting release cycles from weeks to days at CCHQ.",
  "action": "Engineered modular full-stack services from monolithic applications",
  "outcome": "Cut release cycles from weeks to days"
}
```

## Verification

✅ All 63 technology entries updated  
✅ Strong verbs used consistently across all categories  
✅ Action-outcome relationship preserved  
✅ Employer context maintained  
✅ Measurable results included  

## Next Steps

The JSON is now optimized with strong, action-oriented verbs that:
1. Demonstrate technical leadership
2. Show ownership and initiative
3. Emphasize measurable business impact
4. Maintain professional tone throughout
